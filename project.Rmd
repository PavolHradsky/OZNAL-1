```{r load}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("AB_NYC_2019.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
data
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
